There are many reasons why we would want to exposing our local web server to the internet. For example, we need public URLs:

- for testing on mobile devices

- for demoing from your own machine

All that tasks could be resolved by **[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)**. This is useful tool that are free for default. It is simply to installed and gives powerfull posibilities in work.

Let's look at a concrete example. You works on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) with project that uses bunch with php and apache. You plan to add AMP for your website, so you need to have public URL with secure protocol (https).

So, following step by step:
1) Sign up on official ngrok's site: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/user/signup

3) Open terminal and unzip downloaded archieve: `$ /path/to/ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip`
4) Connect your account: `$ ./ngrok authtoken your_personal_autogenerated_token`
5) Set next file's mode: `$ chmod +x ngrok`
6) Then move it: `$ sudo mv ngrok /usr/bin/`
7) And finally run next command: `$ ngrok http -host-header=rewrite your.site.url:80`
